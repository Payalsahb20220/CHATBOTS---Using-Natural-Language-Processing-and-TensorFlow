Chatbots - Using Natural Language Processing and TensorFlow
Overview
This repository contains a project aimed at building a sophisticated chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and TensorFlow. The chatbot is designed to understand the context of user inputs and respond appropriately, providing an engaging and interactive user experience.

Project Highlights
1. Transforming Conversational Intents into a TensorFlow Model
NLP Techniques: Preprocess and understand conversational intents using various NLP techniques.
Neural Network: Build and train a neural network using TFLEARN, a high-level API for TensorFlow.
Model Saving: Save the trained model and relevant data as a pickle file for easy reuse and deployment.
2. Building the Chatbot Framework
Loading the Model: Load the saved model and pickle file to create a framework for processing user inputs.
Response Generation: Utilize the trained neural network to generate context-aware responses, ensuring meaningful interactions.
3. Input Processing and Response Demonstration
Input Analysis: Demonstrate how user inputs are processed by the framework.
Contextual Responses: Show the chatbot's ability to provide appropriate responses based on learned conversational patterns.


Getting Started


Prerequisites

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
TFLEARN
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
NumPy

Installation

Clone the repository:

Copy code- git clone https://github.com/Payalsahb20220/CHATBOTS---Using-Natural-Language-Processing-and-TensorFlow.git

cd chatbot-nlp-tensorflow

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Training the Model:
Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and save it as a pickle file.
Building the Framework:
Load the saved model and pickle file to create the chatbot framework.
Testing the Chatbot:
Interact with the chatbot to see how it processes inputs and generates responses.
